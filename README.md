## codes introduction
I wrote the serial version (you can find the single_proc.cpp in the serial folder), the striped decomposition solver and grid decomposition solver (they are all in the **“DataType.h”, “DataType.cpp”, “tidy.cpp”** ). In addition, I also uploaded the version for high performance calculation called **‘game_class.cpp’**, and you can see the **Makefile** and **pbs** file on github. In the import data folder, there is a “ipynb” file called **“video_produce.ipynb”** (this file generates the figure 1), this file can merge the output files generated by each processor and make video and gif pictures of the whole iteration process.If you wan test the solution of this game, just change the bool variable **verify** into true, after finishing running the tidy.cpp the screen will show you wthether the result is correct.  

My codes can generate arbitrary size cells and the status of cells is random, and in the **“test_proportion”** folder you can see another version **‘game_class.cpp’** file, this file can generate fix initial proportion of live cells when you change the **distribution(probability ) function**.  In this folder, **“get_picture.ipynb”** and **“different_init.ipynb”**can generate the Figure 3 below. In the subordinate directory “import data” folder the **“ video_produce.ipynb”** can generate the figure 2.

In folder **“performance_analysis”** I store the high performance data (including grid domain and striped domain for different matrix size and different core number, in addition, I add the serial related data ). There is a **“performance_analysis.ipynb”** file handling the data in this folder and producing the performance analysis figures.(Fig5,6,7)

I upload a video called **"import_data1582366604.mp4"** which can show you the evolution of this game,and you can also see the gif form in the **import data forder** called animation.gif

In the codes, when the splited columns or rows are equal to 1, it will use striped solver.(you can see this in "tidy.cpp")
